# Registration-form-app
This project implements a simple registration form with basic input validation.

The HTML structure defines the form elements (username, email, password, confirm password, and submit button).
The CSS styles the form with a visually appealing design.
The JavaScript handles form submission, validates user inputs, and displays error messages for invalid entries.
